1. FILE basis_matrix_printed.m contains the basis matrix B printed as a sequence containing nullity terms with each term having d terms.

2. FILES field_in_magma.m, h-poly.m, I-poly.m, prime-and-degrees.m contains a description of the finite fields. 

3. FILE part_soln_printed.m contains a particular solution realised as a sequence of d terms.

4. FILE powers_of_U_from_0_to_d_minus_1.m contains the powers of U, i.e., U^i for i=0,1,...,(d-1).

5. FILE target_poly.m contains the target polynomial T0.

6. FILE nullity_printed.m contains our nullity

7. FILE verify.m contains a verification code which tries to verify that our polynomial is indeed B smooth for the said B and is of the form V.T0 for an element V in the proper subfield.

8. FILES output-28-verify.txt, output-30-verify.txt contains the output when the code verify.m is run for B=28, 30 respectively.
